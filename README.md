# TransitTrek

This project involves creating a dataset on the distance, travel time and cost to get from Europe's airports to the city centre. 

## Purpose

I want to use this repo for two reasons:

1. I want to answer the question, "If I fly to this airport, how much more travel time and cost are involved getting from the airport into the city". 

2. I want to use ChatGPT's API and get good at getting information back in JSON format. Apparently fiddling with the parameters is important. 

I want to try and do the whole thing in Python.

## Brainstorming

When I lived in Observatory, Cape Town, it was fantastic to live 10 minutes from the airport as well as 10 minutes from the University of Cape Town, where I studied. Peak travel convenience was flying back to my parents house. They live 10 minutes from King Shaka airport, and look onto the sea. What a treat.

Now I live in Lund, Sweden, which is also conveniently close to a great airport. Copenhagen International is only a 35 minute train ride away.
